    "A process pool is a programming construct used to manage and execute multiple processes efficiently, particularly in parallel computing. It is a collection of pre-instantiated, reusable processes that can be assigned tasks by the system. The main idea behind a process pool is to reduce the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly, which can be computationally expensive.\n",

    "efficiently benefits:\n",
    "Reduced Overhead: Creating and destroying processes can consume significant system resources. By reusing processes from the pool, the overhead of repeatedly creating processes is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Execution: Multiple processes in the pool can run tasks in parallel, taking advantage of multi-core processors and speeding up computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Balancing: The pool dynamically assigns tasks to processes, which ensures that the workload is evenly distributed, preventing any single process from becoming a bottleneck.\n",
